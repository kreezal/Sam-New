        			<p>I just finished up with my first BASS Central Open on Ross Barnett in Ridgeland, MS. This was my first time to ever be on that lake and I am very pleased with my finish. My main goal for this event was to not take myself out of the points range for the year.</p> 

					<p>My practice was an OK practice on Saturday and Sunday but when Monday came I found the mother load, atleast I thought I did. I found some stumps and ditches that ran through lilly pad stems in the main lake area and I noticed everybody was burning a spinnerbait or chatter bait so I started slow rolling a half ounce black and blue Death Shimmer spinnerbait on a Denali Kovert Spinnerbait rod on the bottom and it was lights out. By the end of Monday's practice I had over 26 lbs, at that point I really thought it was a done deal so the next two days of practice I tried to duplicate what I found but I couldn't. So, on Wednesday about 10am, I picked up a Pelican Lures buzzbait and again had another great day. So I had two patterns I could use and had alot of confidence going into the first day of the tournament.</p> 

					<p>I was boat number 64 and when I got to my area there was 8 boats already there in a very small area but I didn't let that bother me. I had my limit in the first hour using the buzzbait and a Creme stickbait. I stayed in that area until around 11am and everything we were catching was all buck bass so I decided to make a move to my next area. When I got there, there were several boats in that area as well, again I just did my thing and went fishing, I ended up culling everything but one in that area with about 30 minutes until weigh in. I caught my biggest fish of the day using a buzzbait on a Denali Jadewood medium heavy rod in some lilly pad stems. After day 1, I was sitting in 14th with 14.14 lbs, which was a very good start to the tournament and the year. <p>

					<p>The second day of the tournament I was boat 134 so I knew there would be a pile of boats in the area I started in the first day but I went anyway. I stayed there again until 11am or so. When I left, I had one 12 inch keeper; that was it. I arrived at my next spot and stayed til 3pm and not a bite at that point, my mind started spinning. I had an hour and half left to fish and had one keeper so I made another move close to the area I started at. When I got there it was 3:30pm. I wasn't there 5 minutes and caught another keeper on the buzzbait, then it was 4pm and I had ten minutes before I had to leave. I picked up a spinnerbait again and it was on. In those next ten minutes I filled my limit and culled 4 times. I really believe if I had 5 more minutes I could have made the top 12 but I will take what I can. The second day I weighed in with 11.3 lbs which gave me a total of 26.1 lbs and took 21st place.</p> 

					<p>I want to say congratulations to my travel partners Matthew Delaney for the 14th place and Stephen Browning for the 5th place finish. Also want to say thanks to my sponsors for believing in me and giving me a chance. Denali Rods, Pelican Lures, Cajun Tackle House, Skirmish Baits, Creme, Stanley Lures, and Death Shimmer.</p>

        			<h3 class="blog-title">FORT GIBSON</h3>

        			<p>The second central open is in the books. I want to give a huge thanks to my parents, uncle, and family from Oklahoma for making it to the weigh-ins. I couldn’t chase this dream without their love and support. And after my first few days of practice at Fort Gibson (I only caught a few keepers), support is exactly what I needed.</p> 

					<p>I relied on my strengths for this tournament and decided to stay up the river, fishing the same way I did growing up. A big rain hit us on the last day of practice, which gave me an idea.  And it wasn’t long before I found what I was looking for.</p>

					<p>After the rain the river accumulated a lot of current, pulling fish out of the creek mouths into the river. If I could find a way to get some bites at these key points, I knew I could win. I ran three different spots and had close to 20lbs. I left confident but knew there was a chance the current could let up and ruin this strategy by the time the tournament started.</p> 

					<p>I barely slept the next night wondering how much the current would change. Before I took off that morning I checked the river gauges and realized that the current was gone for the most part, but I decided to make the run regardless.</p>

					<p>As suspected, the fish had left the areas I found the day before. Starting from scratch I explored the area and found a special spot. All ten of my weigh fish come from one log using a Denali shakey head rod with a drop shop. The most effective bait was a roboworm (one of the last things I would have expected). All in all I wrapped up Fort Gibson with a 25th place finish leaving me in the Top 10 for AOY.</p>

        			<h3 class="blog-title">TABLE ROCK</h3>

        			<p>The last open of the year was one I will never forget. It was at Table Rock Lake, a lake that is very clear compared to what I usually fish. The first two days of practice were a little tough for me.  I think the clear, deep water freaked me out at first. On the third day of practice I thought I had found something very special.  I was doing something that I had never done before, flipping docks with a spoon like a jig. Over the next few days I thought I was in the zone.</p> 

					<p>The morning before the tournament there wasn't a doubt in my mind that I could have weighed in between 16 to 18lbs per day. The fish obviously had other plans because they never showed up to the party. The first morning of the tournament started off slow. I managed to scrounge up a limit by junk fishing. The second day was one of those where everything went right. I didn't have a giant bag but it was a very special day to me. As we left that morning I could feel that things were going to go right and someone very special was looking over me.</p>

					<p>My grandmother had passed away a few months before this tournament. She meant more to me than she’ll ever know.  And I know that she was with me on this day.  It wasn't long before I had my limit.  I felt compelled to go to a spot that I had fished the first day of practice, so I did. Within the next hour I culled everything I had with smallmouth, the first smallmouth I had caught during the open.</p> 

					<p>Continuing down the bank I used one deep diving crankbait that was practically a square bill because I had hit so many rocks with it. As I went to throw it, my line snapped at the reel and my bait went flying. There was a dead tree about 15 feet away on the bank with one twig sticking out the top. The bait hit this specific twig and bounced all the way back to the edge of the water.  After retrieving the bait I caught my first walleye and rainbow trout, culling a few more times. As I got to the weigh-in I saw that a lot of the weights were lower. I weighed in just over 12lbs of small mouth, which was good enough for a top 12.</p>

					<p>So there I was on the final morning sitting in the water, ready to compete with some of the best anglers in the world. The last day of the tournament was a struggle but after making the top 12 I decided to go for broke. Before now I was content fishing for the AOY points, but since I was already in 12th I couldn't risk dropping any lower. Starting from scratch I picked a bait that could catch bigger fish and took off.  This turned out to be a crucial mistake.</p>

					<p>After we all weighed in Chris announced the qualifiers for the elite series. This is a day that I will never forget.  I had set two specific goals for myself this year: a top 12 finish, and qualifying for the elite series. And both were happening at this moment.  Although I qualified to fish the elites, financially there was no way I could do it on my own. So I reached out to every company I could think of for financial backing with no luck.</p>

					<p>I am a firm believer that whatever is going to happen, will happen. I gave 100% but it just wasn't meant to be this go round. I want to say a special thank you to my family that came to the weigh-in on the final day. And a special thanks to my wife for helping me chase this crazy dream. Not to mention all the calls and texts I received from friends.</p>

					<p>Last but certainly not least, thank you to the folks from Ranger, Yamaha, Powerpole and Hummingbird that work at the tournaments. Anyone who knows me knows that I don’t have the best luck and there wasn't a single tournament that I didn't need one of these guys.  Without them, myself and a lot of other guys would not have been able to fish the tournaments.</p>

					<p>The 2015 season is done. I gave it everything I had but now it’s time to get ready for 2016. Hopefully it will be a turning point in our lives.</p>
