        			<p>I just finished up with my first BASS Central Open on Ross Barnett in Ridgeland, MS. This was my first time to ever be on that lake and I am very pleased with my finish. My main goal for this event was to not take myself out of the points range for the year. <a href="Blog/2016/01/ross-barnett-blog.html">read more</a></p>

        			<p>The second central open is in the books. I want to give a huge thanks to my parents, uncle, and family from Oklahoma for making it to the weigh-ins. I couldn&#39;t chase this dream without their love and support. And after my first few days of practice at Fort Gibson (I only caught a few keepers), support is exactly what I needed. <a href="Blog/2016/02/fort-gibson-blog.html">read more</a></p>

        			<h3 class="blog-title">BASS CENTRAL OPEN - TABLE ROCK, MO</h3>

        			<p>The last open of the year was one I will never forget. It was at Table Rock Lake, a lake that is very clear compared to what I usually fish. The first two days of practice were a little tough for me.  I think the clear, deep water freaked me out at first. On the third day of practice I thought I had found something very special.  I was doing something that I had never done before, flipping docks with a spoon like a jig. Over the next few days I thought I was in the zone. <a href="Blog/2016/02/table-rock-blog.html">read more</a></p>
