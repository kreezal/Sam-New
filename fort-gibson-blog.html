        			<p>The second central open is in the books. I want to give a huge thanks to my parents, uncle, and family from Oklahoma for making it to the weigh-ins. I couldn’t chase this dream without their love and support. And after my first few days of practice at Fort Gibson (I only caught a few keepers), support is exactly what I needed.</p> 

					<p>I relied on my strengths for this tournament and decided to stay up the river, fishing the same way I did growing up. A big rain hit us on the last day of practice, which gave me an idea.  And it wasn’t long before I found what I was looking for.</p>

					<p>After the rain the river accumulated a lot of current, pulling fish out of the creek mouths into the river. If I could find a way to get some bites at these key points, I knew I could win. I ran three different spots and had close to 20lbs. I left confident but knew there was a chance the current could let up and ruin this strategy by the time the tournament started.</p> 

					<p>I barely slept the next night wondering how much the current would change. Before I took off that morning I checked the river gauges and realized that the current was gone for the most part, but I decided to make the run regardless.</p>

					<p>As suspected, the fish had left the areas I found the day before. Starting from scratch I explored the area and found a special spot. All ten of my weigh fish come from one log using a Denali shakey head rod with a drop shop. The most effective bait was a roboworm (one of the last things I would have expected). All in all I wrapped up Fort Gibson with a 25th place finish leaving me in the Top 10 for AOY.</p>
