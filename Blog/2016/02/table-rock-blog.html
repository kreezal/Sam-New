        			<p>The last open of the year was one I will never forget. It was at Table Rock Lake, a lake that is very clear compared to what I usually fish. The first two days of practice were a little tough for me.  I think the clear, deep water freaked me out at first. On the third day of practice I thought I had found something very special.  I was doing something that I had never done before, flipping docks with a spoon like a jig. Over the next few days I thought I was in the zone.</p> 

					<p>The morning before the tournament there wasn&#8217t a doubt in my mind that I could have weighed in between 16 to 18lbs per day. The fish obviously had other plans because they never showed up to the party. The first morning of the tournament started off slow. I managed to scrounge up a limit by junk fishing. The second day was one of those where everything went right. I didn&#8217t have a giant bag but it was a very special day to me. As we left that morning I could feel that things were going to go right and someone very special was looking over me.</p>

					<p>My grandmother had passed away a few months before this tournament. She meant more to me than she&#8217ll ever know.  And I know that she was with me on this day.  It wasn&#8217t long before I had my limit.  I felt compelled to go to a spot that I had fished the first day of practice, so I did. Within the next hour I culled everything I had with smallmouth, the first smallmouth I had caught during the open.</p> 

					<p>Continuing down the bank I used one deep diving crankbait that was practically a square bill because I had hit so many rocks with it. As I went to throw it, my line snapped at the reel and my bait went flying. There was a dead tree about 15 feet away on the bank with one twig sticking out the top. The bait hit this specific twig and bounced all the way back to the edge of the water.  After retrieving the bait I caught my first walleye and rainbow trout, culling a few more times. As I got to the weigh-in I saw that a lot of the weights were lower. I weighed in just over 12lbs of small mouth, which was good enough for a top 12.</p>

					<p>So there I was on the final morning sitting in the water, ready to compete with some of the best anglers in the world. The last day of the tournament was a struggle but after making the top 12 I decided to go for broke. Before now I was content fishing for the AOY points, but since I was already in 12th I couldn&#8217t risk dropping any lower. Starting from scratch I picked a bait that could catch bigger fish and took off.  This turned out to be a crucial mistake.</p>

					<p>After we all weighed in Chris announced the qualifiers for the elite series. This is a day that I will never forget.  I had set two specific goals for myself this year: a top 12 finish, and qualifying for the elite series. And both were happening at this moment.  Although I qualified to fish the elites, financially there was no way I could do it on my own. So I reached out to every company I could think of for financial backing with no luck.</p>

					<p>I am a firm believer that whatever is going to happen, will happen. I gave 100% but it just wasn&#8217t meant to be this go round. I want to say a special thank you to my family that came to the weigh-in on the final day. And a special thanks to my wife for helping me chase this crazy dream. Not to mention all the calls and texts I received from friends.</p>

					<p>Last but certainly not least, thank you to the folks from Ranger, Yamaha, Powerpole and Hummingbird that work at the tournaments. Anyone who knows me knows that I donâ€™t have the best luck and there wasn&#8217t a single tournament that I didn&#8217t need one of these guys.  Without them, myself and a lot of other guys would not have been able to fish the tournaments.</p>

					<p>The 2015 season is done. I gave it everything I had but now it&#8217s time to get ready for 2016. Hopefully it will be a turning point in our lives.</p>
